## FAQ

### Where is the Invoice Number?

It's [looks like this](https://www.google.co.id/search?tbm=isch&sa=1&q=asset+store+invoice+number#imgrc=50Jru4WMbMVksM:). And you won't find it anywhere except in email attachment that were sent during purchase confirmation.

### What happens if I click Submit?

Series of Authentication will be performed. If everything is OK your invoice and its associated GitLab account will be recorded to our database, and your Gitlab account will be granted with related asset.

### Can I attach multiple GitLab account under the same Invoice?

[**No**](https://giant.gfycat.com/ShockingSardonicDalmatian.gif)

### Can I change the GitLab account that associated with current Invoice?

No, atleast it have to be done manually. Send me an email if it important.

### This thing strangely not working for me.

If you are the person that has refunded your purchase or getting the package via free vouchers somewhere. You can't, atleast the authentication has to be done manually.

Otherwise screenshot the message and tell me about it.

### I have another problem.
